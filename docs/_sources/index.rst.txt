Welcome to Django API Bouncer's documentation!
==============================================
Django API Bouncer can help you to quickly setup an API gateway for your Django
projects. The idea behind it is simple, add APIs, configure plugins for your
APIs and that's it.

Django API Bouncer is (heavily) inspired by Kong.
